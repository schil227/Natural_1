== DONE STUFF == 
-Add ownedBy, isStolen to item (DONE)
-trigger stolen event when player picks up an owned item (dont trigger if player has already stole it) (DONE)
-when reporting crimes, the witness is dropped (DONE)
-if a player already has a reported crime with a specific composite id, they cannot gain it again either by reporting or active (DONE)
-If an individual is hostile with the player, their special dialog is changed [follow up can check for crimes] (DONE)
-if the victim of a crime forgives the player, witnesses should as well. (DONE)
-be able to actually rob individuals (DONE)
-Add a =cannot yield== flag to npc that gets cleared when they leave the area. (DONE)
-Decrease player turn on failed pickpocket attempt and on inventory view close (DONE)
-When pickpocket and intimidating, there are still crimes being reported - make sure remove all crimes accounts for those. (DONE)
-Rob and beat to death -> crimes still reported (DONE)
-Pickpocketing - item is in double jepordy when it shouldn't be (DONE)
-on report active crimes,  check if the witness exists - if not, dont add it (DONE)
-Guard will talk to player after they commit a crime, if theyre in range (DONE)
-Guard should pursue player (and talk to them) if they have an outstanding bounty (DONE)
-Fix tryTalk to not be stupid (DONE)
-After surrendering, the guard still attacked for a few more turns - probably because player was still the targeted individual; check if player is still target and hostile (DONE)
-moveIndividual (function, field.c, line ~153) should it be updated so that the player can move through allies, just not rest on their spaces? Shadowing would have to change, maybe (DONE)
-Fix the tests! (DONE)
-[Action Mode] popup when it starts (ONE)

==DEFERRED==
-Pickpocked individual 3 times, only caught on the last, shouldn't have had crimes activated (DONE: could not replicate/may be sneak bug)
-Guard wants to keep talking after player rejects surrender - should be immediately hostile (DONE: this is because the player is sneaking, and the guard cant see the player to make them targeted - should be fleshed out when updating sneak)
