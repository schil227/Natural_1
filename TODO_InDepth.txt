Implementing Statuses:
	-Poison (DONE)
	-Paralysis (DONE)
	-Burning (DONE)
	-Bleeding (DONE)
	-Confusion - target anyone, including themselves
	-Sleeping (DONE)
	-Berzerk - attack boost, DR loss, still attack enemies, albeit randomly
	-Silence - cant use abilities (or speak?) (DONE - excluding speak)

	-Confusion for player:
		-The selected individual doesn't matter, be it for using an ability, attack, talking, etc.
		-if trying to use an item, chance that they may not succeed (item not lost)
		
	-Confusion for AI:
		-targeted individual/targeted ally are whomever's in range; if poor choice is made,target is rerolled. all targets last significantly shorter 
		-if trying to use an item, chance that they may not succeed (item not lost)
				
				
				
-Issue with guards: not going into alert mode (wasRecentlyAttacked) because blocked by trying to find individual

-Implementing async FreeMode
	-HARD PART: performing this asynchronously means that the player cant be blocked by other indiviuals 
		- need to share moveNodeMeta resources (unless just immediately moving player, need to slow it down however)
		- need to listen to ALL types of keyinputs on processAction loop
	-(player) actions dont decrease
	-other individuals may wander, speak, idle AI, etc. every second (or every few) on check
	-active status/abilities are checked on second mark
	
	
problem: player cant move when others are moving; therefore, the action system needs to stay
e.g.: there are 30 individuals all moving around sequentially, takes 1 second for them all to move
 -> must be done sequentially because individuals could exist on the same space
 -> must only move one space because multiple could exist on same space
	--> Idea: let them move instantaneously, no root to next node wait, (would still eat commands)

== DONE STUFF == 
-Add ownedBy, isStolen to item (DONE)
-trigger stolen event when player picks up an owned item (dont trigger if player has already stole it) (DONE)
-when reporting crimes, the witness is dropped (DONE)
-if a player already has a reported crime with a specific composite id, they cannot gain it again either by reporting or active (DONE)
-If an individual is hostile with the player, their special dialog is changed [follow up can check for crimes] (DONE)
-if the victim of a crime forgives the player, witnesses should as well. (DONE)
-be able to actually rob individuals (DONE)
-Add a =cannot yield== flag to npc that gets cleared when they leave the area. (DONE)
-Decrease player turn on failed pickpocket attempt and on inventory view close (DONE)
-When pickpocket and intimidating, there are still crimes being reported - make sure remove all crimes accounts for those. (DONE)
-Rob and beat to death -> crimes still reported (DONE)
-Pickpocketing - item is in double jepordy when it shouldn't be (DONE)
-on report active crimes,  check if the witness exists - if not, dont add it (DONE)
-Guard will talk to player after they commit a crime, if theyre in range (DONE)
-Guard should pursue player (and talk to them) if they have an outstanding bounty (DONE)
-Fix tryTalk to not be stupid (DONE)
-After surrendering, the guard still attacked for a few more turns - probably because player was still the targeted individual; check if player is still target and hostile (DONE)
-moveIndividual (function, field.c, line ~153) should it be updated so that the player can move through allies, just not rest on their spaces? Shadowing would have to change, maybe (DONE)
-Fix the tests! (DONE)
-[Action Mode] popup when it starts (ONE)

==DEFERRED==
-Pickpocked individual 3 times, only caught on the last, shouldn't have had crimes activated (DONE: could not replicate/may be sneak bug)
-Guard wants to keep talking after player rejects surrender - should be immediately hostile (DONE: this is because the player is sneaking, and the guard cant see the player to make them targeted - should be fleshed out when updating sneak)



== NOTES == 
Implement double jepordy check for crimes (e.g. cant get assault or murder twice)
Cant steal the same item twice (e.g. drop pickup drop pickup)
	- murder: the victim  can only be claimed once
	- assault: the victim will likely be assaulted several times - once per victim & witness (e.g. multiple people can witness the crime, only once)
	- pickpocket: once per victim per item per witness
	-stolen: once per item per witness - once stolen, it is owned, BUT can be taken back, so it needs the stolen flag.
