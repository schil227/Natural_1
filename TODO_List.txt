===================
==== TODO LIST ====
===================
- (2/13/17) Make the ability creator more intuitive & remove stuff that doesnt have an effect for certain abilities from the description (e.g. sleep spell, remove dice damage)
- (5/1/17) Make a Metropolis with at least 25 individuals to see how performant it is. 
- (6/26/17) update look function to display intractable objects
- (6/27/17) Develop a map transition animation (fade to/from black?)
- (7/11/17) Character info should show proper damageoutput and fate tokens


==BUGS==
- (4/30/17) Got in a fight with the guard, hit 'w' a bunch of times, looked like it was stacking during the guards turn(guard was attacking over and over)
-(6/20/17) In map 5, sometimes the grass spaces by the lake become impassable; not sure why. Could be from other undefined behavior.
-(6/28/17) add lock around ability create logic, getting race condition when done creating ability and drawing current create view 

==BACK BURNER==
- (11/12/16) Add casting animations
- (2/21/17) Abilities: change to points (e.g. if you want to cast an ability between 5 and 10 spaces, it would cost 50  points, to use it between 0 and 4 with a hinderance, it would cost an additional 25, etc.)
- (4/17/17) Larger window draws more, bigger slowdown, find optimizations. See if I should convert to DirectX to draw (maybe with sound as well)
- (5/25/17) Make the main window run completely seperate from the tests (e.g. build/destroy everything, build resources that only need to be built once like Sound)
- (6/1/17) Make it so events dont chain together, rather an event encapsulates several smaller independent events.
