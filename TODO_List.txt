==== TODO LIST ====
===================
- (11/12/16) Implement Crimes
- (11/12/16) Update path finding algorithm (and consequently tests) to 

==BACK BURNER==
- (11/12/16) for some reason, there's a lot of slowdown when drawing a rotated image mask, so I had to make a separate function just to draw the image without the mask (which works as intended). Not sure if this is something I'll ever have to fix, but for awareness.
- (11/12/16) Add more enemies to the field
- (11/12/16) Add casting animations
