===================
==== TODO LIST ====
===================
- (11/27/16) Update images to be 2x long. At 30 fps the animations are the right tempo, too jittery at 60
- (12/22/16) Crime: implement order (lose money/go to jail)
- (12/22/16) Fix slowness with NPC action
- (12/29/16) Differentiate between isPassable and CanAttackThrough for spaces, algorithms obtaining targetIndividuals
- (1/10/17) Fog of War
- (1/21/17) Fix Viewshift to be consistant between changing locations
- (1/21/17) Implement non-combat mode
- (1/27/17) Implement remaining statuses
- (1/27/17) Disallow statuses from stacking

==BUGS==
- (11/25/16) player enters/exits shop, skeletons occupy the same space as him when pathfinding
   -also viewshift sucks - related somehow? probably not

==BACK BURNER==
- (11/12/16) for some reason, there's a lot of slowdown when drawing a rotated image mask, so I had to make a separate function just to draw the image without the mask (which works as intended). Not sure if this is something I'll ever have to fix, but for awareness.
- (11/12/16) Add more enemies to the field
- (11/12/16) Add casting animations
- (1/1/17) Put dialog box/speaker image over console output

==FINISHED==
- (11/12/16 - 10/22/16) Implement Crimes (DONE)
- (11/28/16 - 10/23/16) After making the npc an enemy then an npc again, they'll still retreat from the player - del target (DONE-could not replicate, looks correct)
- (11/12/16 - 12/29/16) Update path finding algorithm (and consequently tests) to allow ally passthrough only (DONE)
- (11/28/16 - 12/29/16) Update the enemy acquireTarget function - go for closest enemy in sight or player (DONE)
- (11/27/16 - 1/?/17) When skelly attack, there appears to be another image drawn behind them (DONE)
- (12/22/16) Unit Test individual actions and crime (DONE)
