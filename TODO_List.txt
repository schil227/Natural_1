===================
==== TODO LIST ====
===================
- (12/22/16) Crime: implement order (lose money/go to jail)
- (1/27/17) Disallow statuses from stacking (no?)
- (2/13/17) Make the ability creator more intuitive & remove stuff that doesnt have an effect for certain abilities from the description (e.g. sleep spell, remove dice damage)
- (3/30/17) Convert from setTimer to TimerQueueTimer
- (4/2/17) Add locks to applicable drawing resources

==BUGS==
- (2/18/17) When someone uses a status on someone else, it says that the attacked person uses the status
- (2/18/17) Sometimes Berzerking/Confused individuals cause the game to crash, may have something to do with being removed from the group prematurely
   
==BACK BURNER==
- (11/12/16) for some reason, there's a lot of slowdown when drawing a rotated image mask, so I had to make a separate function just to draw the image without the mask (which works as intended). Not sure if this is something I'll ever have to fix, but for awareness.
- (11/12/16) Add more enemies to the field
- (11/12/16) Add casting animations
- (1/1/17) Put dialog box/speaker image over console output
- (2/21/17) Abilities: change to points (e.g. if you want to cast an ability between 5 and 10 spaces, it would cost 50  points, to use it between 0 and 4 with a hinderance, it would cost an additional 25, etc.)
- (1/10/17) Fog of War

==FINISHED==
- (11/12/16 - 10/22/16) Implement Crimes (DONE)
- (11/28/16 - 10/23/16) After making the npc an enemy then an npc again, they'll still retreat from the player - del target (DONE-could not replicate, looks correct)
- (11/12/16 - 12/29/16) Update path finding algorithm (and consequently tests) to allow ally passthrough only (DONE)
- (11/28/16 - 12/29/16) Update the enemy acquireTarget function - go for closest enemy in sight or player (DONE)
- (11/27/16 - 1/?/17) When skelly attack, there appears to be another image drawn behind them (DONE)
- (12/22/16) Unit Test individual actions and crime (DONE)
- (11/27/16 - 1/26/17) Update images to be 2x long. At 30 fps the animations are the right tempo, too jittery at 60 (DONE - fixed with processing individual action in timing look)
- (12/22/16 - 1/26/17) Fix slowness with NPC action (DONE - fixed with processing individual action in timing look)
- (1/28/17 - 2/2/17) When Individual is attacked, and the attacker cannot be seen, have them move around (DONE)
- (1/21/17 - 2/6/17) Fix Viewshift to be consistant between changing locations (DONE)
- (1/21/17 - 2/1/17) Implement non-combat mode (DONE)
- (1/27/17 - 2/21/17) Implement remaining statuses (DONE)
- (12/29/16 - 2/23/17) Differentiate between isPassable and CanAttackThrough for spaces, algorithms obtaining targetIndividuals (DONE)
- (2/15/17 - 3/16/17) Implement ally group (DONE)
- (11/25/16) player enters/exits shop, skeletons occupy the same space as him when pathfinding. Also viewshift sucks - related somehow? probably not (DONE)
- (3/6/17 - 3/22/17) Change map loading to use registry, registry will keep track of what items/individuals are on what maps (DONE)
- (3/16/17 - 3/26/17) drop item functionality (DONE)
- (3/23/17 - 3/29/17) add simple movement animation (DONE)
- (4/2/17 - 4/12/17) Make homemade bitmap rotating function (DONE)
