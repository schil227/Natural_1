Story:
Overall Theme: Morality
An entity will wipe out the land every 3 thousand years. The reason being all humans will eventually succumb to greed, quality and value of life become severely imbalanced. 
	The player can argue that good people will save this land, reflected upon their good deeds/
	The entity was once a human like the player, however after 'policing' humanity for aeons(?), they have grown old and weary, and thus are ready to be dethroned by the player
	The entity watched the rise and fall of humanity, tasked with swallowing up the towns they created
		-"I will admit... it hurts. Every time I must bring the apocalypse, I always see something that gives me doubt. A woman cradling her baby as the walls come crumbling down... a mortally wounded soldier pulling in vein to lift their comrade hanging over the abyss... Elderly lovers watching the sun set one last time."



-depressed guy in some town joins the player; 
	"You forget most days you're alive. I just want to go anywhere, be anything. I cant stay here any longer". Depression doesn't get resolved.
	[spoiler] "Dying on this bridge in the sunlight was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Thank you, player" [/spoiler]

Ideas:
-man so strong he loses dominant hand when punching
-Sinus infection cause person to go insane
-in final area (auchtend) there will be an inn with the ghost of an inn keeper ("They took my wife... my children... hero... kill this corruption)
-"Its easy to be the good guy when you haven't lost anything"
-Instead of going procedurally through each town, branch to go to other villages/towns on way to final area
-(based on dream) an ally is a bowmaster because when they where young, they lived on a farm and witnessed owls stealing goats and flying away--helpless to only watch.
-NPC says they would have been a master guitar player, but they could never stop biting their fingernails. On hearing this, the player can go to the local blacksmith and ask to forge finger picks for 5 gold. Return with the picks and be rewarded.
-long faced guy: urban legend, has a huge gaping jaw, scary clown like expression (angry grin)
-Enter a dungeon, you see the boss, he watches you progress, you know this. (think labrynth - "Within You")
-A mini boss gets defeated in the 3rd level, says "... I will come back...". Dies, returns in a dreamscape as final boss of level 7
