Natural 1 Ideas:

Story:
-man so strong he loses dominant hand when punching
-Sinus infection cause person to go insane

-depressed guy in some town joins the player; 
	"You forget most days you're alive. I just want to go anywhere, be anything. I cant stay here any longer". Depression doesn't get resolved.
	[spoiler] "Dying on this bridge in the sunlight was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Thank you, player" [/spoiler]

Music:
Rip of song Riki plays w/ leaf

Ideas:
-in final area (auchtend) there will be an inn with the ghost of an inn keeper ("They took my wife... my children... hero... kill this corruption)
-"Its easy to be the good guy when you haven't lost anything"
-Instead of going procedurally through each town, branch to go to other villages/towns on way to final area
-(based on dream) an ally is a bowmaster because when they where young, they lived on a farm and witnessed owls stealing goats and flying away--helpless to only watch.
-NPC says they would have been a master guitar player, but they could never stop biting their fingernails. On hearing this, the player can go to the local blacksmith and ask to forge finger picks for 5 gold. Return with the picks and be rewarded.
-long faced guy: urban legend, has a huge gaping jaw, scary clown like expression (angry grin)
-Enter a dungeon, you see the boss, he watches you progress, you know this. (think labrynth - "Within You")
